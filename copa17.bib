  pages = {3--17},
  abstract = {For the decision theoretic online (DTOL) setting,
    we consider methods to construct algorithms that suffer loss not much more than of any sequence of experts
    distributed along a time interval (shifting experts setting).
    We present a modified version of the method of Mixing Past Posteriors
    which uses as basic algorithm AdaHedge with adaptive learning rate.
    Due to this, we combine the advantages of both algorithms:
    regret bounds are valid in the case of signed unbounded losses of the experts,
    also, we use the shifting regret which is a more optimal characteristic of the algorithm.
    All results are obtained in the adversarial setting---no assumptions are made about the nature of data source.

    We present results of numerical experiments for the case where losses of the experts cannot be bounded in advance.}

  title = {Asymptotic Properties of Nonparametric Estimation on Manifold},
  author = {Yanovich, Yury},
  pages = {18--38},
  abstract = {In many applications, the real high-dimensional data occupy only a very small part in the high dimensional `observation space'
    whose intrinsic dimension is small.
    The most popular model of such data is Manifold model which assumes that the data lie on or near an unknown manifold (Data Manifold, DM) of lower dimensionality
    embedded in an ambient high-dimensional input space (Manifold Assumption about high-dimensional data).
    Manifold Learning is a Dimensionality Reduction problem under the Manifold assumption about the processed data,
    and its goal is to construct a low-dimensional parameterization of the DM (global low-dimensional coordinates on the DM)
    from a finite dataset sampled from the DM.

    Manifold Assumption means that local neighborhood of each manifold point is equivalent to an area of low-dimensional Euclidean space.
    Because of this, most of Manifold Learning algorithms include two parts:
    `local part' in which certain characteristics reflecting low-dimensional local structure of neighborhoods of all sample points
    are constructed via nonparametric estimation,
    and `global part' in which global low-dimensional coordinates on the DM are constructed
    by solving the certain convex optimization problem for specific cost function depending on the local characteristics.
    Both statistical properties of `local part' and its average over manifold are considered in the paper.
    The article is an extension of the paper (Yanovich, 2016) for the case of nonparametric estimation.}

  abstract = {The paper presents some possible approaches to the combination of Conformal Predictors in the binary classification case.
    A first class of methods is based on p-value combination techniques that have been proposed in the context of Statistical Hypothesis Testing;
    a second class is based on the calibration of p-values into Bayes factors. A few methods from these two classes are applied to a real-world case,
    namely the chemoinformatics problem of Compound Activity Prediction.
    Their performance is discussed, showing the different abilities to preserve of validity and improve efficiency.
    The experiments show that P-value combination, in particular Fisher's method, can be advantageous when ranking compounds by strength of evidence.}

  pages = {62--81},
  abstract = {Automatic Face Recognition (AFR) has been the subject of many research studies in the past two decades and has a wide range of applications.
    The provision of some kind of indication of the likelihood of a recognition being correct is a desirable property of AFR techniques in many applications,
    such as for the detection of wanted persons or for performing post-processing in automatic annotation of photographs.
    This paper investigates the use of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework for providing reliable confidence information for AFR.
    In particular we combine CP with two classifiers based on calculating similarities between images using Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) features.
    We examine and compare the performance of several nonconformity measures for the particular task in terms of their accuracy and informational eficiency.}

  abstract = {This paper applies conformal prediction to derive predictive distributions that are valid under a nonparametric assumption.
    Namely, we introduce and explore predictive distribution functions that always satisfy a natural property of validity
    in terms of guaranteed coverage for IID observations.
    The focus is on a prediction algorithm that we call the Least Squares Prediction Machine (LSPM).
    The LSPM generalizes the classical Dempster--Hill predictive distributions to regression problems.
    If the standard parametric assumptions for Least Squares linear regression hold,
    the LSPM is as efficient as the Dempster--Hill procedure, in a natural sense.
    And if those parametric assumptions fail, the LSPM is still valid, provided the observations are IID.}

  abstract = {Today, screening of large compound collections in high throughput screening campaigns form the backbone of early drug discovery.
    Although widely applied, this approach is resource and potentially labour intensive.
    Therefore, improved computational approaches to streamline screening is in high demand.
    In this study we introduce conformal prediction paired with a gain-cost function to make predictions
    in order to maximise the gain of screening campaigns on new screening sets.
    Our results indicate that using 20\% of the screening library as an initial screening set
    and using the data obtained together with a gain-cost function,
    the significance level of the predictor that maximise the gain can be identified.
    Importantly, the parameters for the predictor derived from the initial screening set was highly predictive of the maximal gain also on the remaining data.
    Using this approach, the gain of a screening campaign can be improved considerably.}

  abstract = {We consider the problem of quickest change-point detection in data streams.
    Classical change-point detection procedures, such as CUSUM, Shiryaev-Roberts and Posterior Probability statistics,
    are optimal only if the change-point model is known, which is an unrealistic assumption in typical applied problems.
    Instead we propose a new method for change-point detection based on Inductive Conformal Martingales,
    which requires only the independence and identical distribution of observations.
    We compare the proposed approach to standard methods,
    as well as to change-point detection oracles, which model a typical practical situation
    when we have only imprecise (albeit parametric) information about pre- and post-change data distributions.
    Results of comparison provide evidence that change-point detection based on Inductive Conformal Martingales is an efficient tool,
    capable to work under quite general conditions unlike traditional approaches.}

  title = {On the Calibration of Aggregated Conformal Predictors},
  author = {Henrik Linusson and Ulf Norinder and Henrik Bostr\"om and Ulf Johansson and Tuve L\"ofstr\"om},
  pages = {154--173},
  abstract = {Conformal prediction is a learning framework that produces models that associate with each of their predictions a measure of statistically valid confidence.
    These models are typically constructed on top of traditional machine learning algorithms.
    An important result of conformal prediction theory is that the models produced are provably valid under relatively weak assumptions---in particular,
    their validity is independent of the specific underlying learning algorithm on which they are based.
    Since validity is automatic, much research on conformal predictors has been focused on improving their informational and computational efficiency.
    As part of the efforts in constructing efficient conformal predictors, aggregated conformal predictors were developed,
    drawing inspiration from the field of classification and regression ensembles.
    Unlike early definitions of conformal prediction procedures, the validity of aggregated conformal predictors is not fully understood---while it has been shown
    that they might attain empirical exact validity under certain circumstances,
    their theoretical validity is conditional on additional assumptions that require further clarification.
    In this paper, we show why validity is not automatic for aggregated conformal predictors,
    and provide a revised definition of aggregated conformal predictors that gains approximate validity
    conditional on properties of the underlying learning algorithm.}

    Several different strategies are explored to illustrate the trade off between lowering costs and quality in decisions.

    AUC is used as a performance metric and the number of objects that can be learnt from is constrained.
    Some of the strategies described reach AUC values over 0.9 and outperforms strategies that are more random.
    The strategies that use conformal predictor p-values show varying results, although some are top performing.}

    prediction of objects which can have a given label, instead of usual prediction of labels by objects.
    It is meant that the label reflect some desired property of the object.
    For this kind of task, the conformal prediction framework can provide a prediction set that is a set of objects that are likely to have the label.
    Based on this, we create an on-line protocol of experimental design.
    It includes a choice criterion based on conformal output, and elements of transfer learning in order to keep the validity properties in on-line regime.}

  pages = {266-279},
  abstract = {Multi-label conformal prediction has attracted much attention in the conformal predictor (CP) community.
    In this article, we propose to combine CP with random $k$-labelsets (RA$k$EL) method,
    which is state-of-the-art multi-label classification method for large number of labels.
    In the framework of RA$k$EL, the original problem is reduced to a number of small-sized multi-label classification tasks
    by randomly breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small-sized labelsets,
    and then label powerset (LP) method is employed on these tasks respectively.
    In this work, ICP-RF, an inductive conformal predictor based on random forest,
    is used in each multi-label task in order to get p-values for predictions of the LP model,
    and then the predictions are aggregated to get a final result.
    Experimental results on six benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate the calibration property of ICP-RF as LP models,
    and show that conformal prediction can significantly improve the performances of the proposed approach, which is called RA$k$EL.
    However, the validity property of CP does not hold in CP-RA$k$EL.
    In the future work we will study how to use some new CP techniques to calibrate the new method.}
