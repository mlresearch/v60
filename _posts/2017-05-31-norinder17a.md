title: Maximizing Gain in HTS Screening Using Conformal Prediction
abstract: "Today, screening of large compound collections in high throughput screening
  campaigns form the backbone of early drug discovery.\r Although widely applied,
  this approach is resource and potentially labour intensive.\r Therefore, improved
  computational approaches to streamline screening is in high demand.\r In this study
  we introduce conformal prediction paired with a gain-cost function to make predictions\r
  in order to maximise the gain of screening campaigns on new screening sets.\r Our
  results indicate that using 20\\% of the screening library as an initial screening
  set\r and using the data obtained together with a gain-cost function,\r the significance
  level of the predictor that maximise the gain can be identified.\r Importantly,
  the parameters for the predictor derived from the initial screening set was highly
  predictive of the maximal gain also on the remaining data.\r Using this approach,
  the gain of a screening campaign can be improved considerably."
