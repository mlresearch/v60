title: Multi-class probabilistic classification using inductive and cross Venn–Abers
  predictors
abstract: "Inductive (IVAP) and cross (CVAP) Venn–Abers predictors are computationally
  efficient algorithms for probabilistic prediction in binary classification problems.\r
  We present a new approach to multi-class probability estimation by turning IVAPs
  and CVAPs into multi-class probabilistic predictors.\r The proposed multi-class
  predictors are experimentally more accurate than both uncalibrated predictors and
  existing calibration methods."
