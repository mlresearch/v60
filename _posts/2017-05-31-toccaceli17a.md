title: Combination of Conformal Predictors for Classification
abstract: "The paper presents some possible approaches to the combination of Conformal
  Predictors in the binary classification case.\r A first class of methods is based
  on p-value combination techniques that have been proposed in the context of Statistical
  Hypothesis Testing;\r a second class is based on the calibration of p-values into
  Bayes factors. A few methods from these two classes are applied to a real-world
  case,\r namely the chemoinformatics problem of Compound Activity Prediction.\r Their
  performance is discussed, showing the different abilities to preserve of validity
  and improve efficiency.\r The experiments show that P-value combination, in particular
  Fisherâ€™s method, can be advantageous when ranking compounds by strength of evidence."
