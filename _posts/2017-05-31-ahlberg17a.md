title: Using Conformal Prediction to Prioritize Compound Synthesis in Drug Discovery
abstract: "The choice of how much money and resources to spend to understand certain
  problems is of high interest in many areas.\r This work illustrates how computational
  models can be more tightly coupled with experiments\r to generate decision data
  at lower cost without reducing the quality of the decision.\r Several different
  strategies are explored to illustrate the trade off between lowering costs and quality
  in decisions.\r AUC is used as a performance metric and the number of objects that
  can be learnt from is constrained.\r Some of the strategies described reach AUC
  values over 0.9 and outperforms strategies that are more random.\r The strategies
  that use conformal predictor p-values show varying results, although some are top
  performing."
