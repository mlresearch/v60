title: Prediction of Metabolic Transformations using Cross Venn-ABERS Predictors
abstract: "Prediction of drug metabolism is an important topic in the drug discovery
  process,\r and we here present a study using probabilistic predictions applying
  Cross Venn-ABERS Predictors (CVAPs) on data for site-of-metabolism.\r We used a
  dataset of 73599 biotransformations, applied SMIRKS to define biotransformations
  of interest and constructed five datasets\r where chemical structures were represented
  using signatures descriptors.\r The results show that CVAP produces well-calibrated
  predictions for all datasets with good predictive capability,\r making CVAP an interesting
  method for further exploration in drug discovery applications."
