title: Conformal Prediction for Automatic Face Recognition
abstract: "Automatic Face Recognition (AFR) has been the subject of many research
  studies in the past two decades and has a wide range of applications.\r The provision
  of some kind of indication of the likelihood of a recognition being correct is a
  desirable property of AFR techniques in many applications,\r such as for the detection
  of wanted persons or for performing post-processing in automatic annotation of photographs.\r
  This paper investigates the use of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework for providing
  reliable confidence information for AFR.\r In particular we combine CP with two
  classifiers based on calculating similarities between images using Scale Invariant
  Feature Transformation (SIFT) features.\r We examine and compare the performance
  of several nonconformity measures for the particular task in terms of their accuracy
  and informational eficiency."
