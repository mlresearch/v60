title: Inductive Conformal Martingales for Change-Point Detection
abstract: "We consider the problem of quickest change-point detection in data streams.\r
  Classical change-point detection procedures, such as CUSUM, Shiryaev-Roberts and
  Posterior Probability statistics,\r are optimal only if the change-point model is
  known, which is an unrealistic assumption in typical applied problems.\r Instead
  we propose a new method for change-point detection based on Inductive Conformal
  Martingales,\r which requires only the independence and identical distribution of
  observations.\r We compare the proposed approach to standard methods,\r as well
  as to change-point detection oracles, which model a typical practical situation\r
  when we have only imprecise (albeit parametric) information about pre- and post-change
  data distributions.\r Results of comparison provide evidence that change-point detection
  based on Inductive Conformal Martingales is an efficient tool,\r capable to work
  under quite general conditions unlike traditional approaches."
