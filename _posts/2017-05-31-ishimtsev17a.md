title: Conformal $k$-NN Anomaly Detector for Univariate Data Streams
abstract: "Anomalies in time-series data give essential and often actionable information
  in many applications.\r In this paper we consider a model-free anomaly detection
  method for univariate time-series\r which adapts to non-stationarity in the data
  stream and provides probabilistic abnormality scores based on the conformal prediction
  paradigm.\r Despite its simplicity the method performs on par with complex prediction-based
  models\r on the Numenta Anomaly Detection benchmark and the Yahoo! S5 dataset."
