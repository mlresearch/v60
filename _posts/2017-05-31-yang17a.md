title: 'CP-RA$k$EL: Improving Random $k$-labelsets with Conformal Prediction for Multi-label
  Classification'
abstract: "Multi-label conformal prediction has attracted much attention in the conformal
  predictor (CP) community.\r In this article, we propose to combine CP with random
  $k$-labelsets (RA$k$EL) method,\r which is state-of-the-art multi-label classification
  method for large number of labels.\r In the framework of RA$k$EL, the original problem
  is reduced to a number of small-sized multi-label classification tasks\r by randomly
  breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small-sized labelsets,\r and
  then label powerset (LP) method is employed on these tasks respectively.\r In this
  work, ICP-RF, an inductive conformal predictor based on random forest,\r is used
  in each multi-label task in order to get p-values for predictions of the LP model,\r
  and then the predictions are aggregated to get a final result.\r Experimental results
  on six benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate the calibration property of ICP-RF
  as LP models,\r and show that conformal prediction can significantly improve the
  performances of the proposed approach, which is called RA$k$EL.\r However, the validity
  property of CP does not hold in CP-RA$k$EL.\r In the future work we will study how
  to use some new CP techniques to calibrate the new method."
