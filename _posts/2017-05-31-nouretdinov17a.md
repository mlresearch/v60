title: Reverse Conformal Approach for On-line Experimental Design
abstract: "Conformal prediction is a recently developed framework of confident machine
  learning with guaranteed validity properties for prediction sets.\r In this work
  we study its usage in reversed version of the traditional machine learning problem:\r
  prediction of objects which can have a given label, instead of usual prediction
  of labels by objects.\r It is meant that the label reflect some desired property
  of the object.\r For this kind of task, the conformal prediction framework can provide
  a prediction set that is a set of objects that are likely to have the label.\r Based
  on this, we create an on-line protocol of experimental design.\r It includes a choice
  criterion based on conformal output, and elements of transfer learning in order
  to keep the validity properties in on-line regime."
