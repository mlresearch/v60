title: Nonparametric predictive distributions based on conformal prediction
abstract: "This paper applies conformal prediction to derive predictive distributions
  that are valid under a nonparametric assumption.\r Namely, we introduce and explore
  predictive distribution functions that always satisfy a natural property of validity\r
  in terms of guaranteed coverage for IID observations.\r The focus is on a prediction
  algorithm that we call the Least Squares Prediction Machine (LSPM).\r The LSPM generalizes
  the classical Dempster–Hill predictive distributions to regression problems.\r If
  the standard parametric assumptions for Least Squares linear regression hold,\r
  the LSPM is as efficient as the Dempster–Hill procedure, in a natural sense.\r And
  if those parametric assumptions fail, the LSPM is still valid, provided the observations
  are IID."
