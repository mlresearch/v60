title: Asymptotic Properties of Nonparametric Estimation on Manifold
abstract: "In many applications, the real high-dimensional data occupy only a very
  small part in the high dimensional ‘observation space’\r whose intrinsic dimension
  is small.\r The most popular model of such data is Manifold model which assumes
  that the data lie on or near an unknown manifold (Data Manifold, DM) of lower dimensionality\r
  embedded in an ambient high-dimensional input space (Manifold Assumption about high-dimensional
  data).\r Manifold Learning is a Dimensionality Reduction problem under the Manifold
  assumption about the processed data,\r and its goal is to construct a low-dimensional
  parameterization of the DM (global low-dimensional coordinates on the DM)\r from
  a finite dataset sampled from the DM.\r Manifold Assumption means that local neighborhood
  of each manifold point is equivalent to an area of low-dimensional Euclidean space.\r
  Because of this, most of Manifold Learning algorithms include two parts:\r ‘local
  part’ in which certain characteristics reflecting low-dimensional local structure
  of neighborhoods of all sample points\r are constructed via nonparametric estimation,\r
  and ‘global part’ in which global low-dimensional coordinates on the DM are constructed\r
  by solving the certain convex optimization problem for specific cost function depending
  on the local characteristics.\r Both statistical properties of ‘local part’ and
  its average over manifold are considered in the paper.\r The article is an extension
  of the paper (Yanovich, 2016) for the case of nonparametric estimation."
