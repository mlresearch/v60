title: Improving Reliable Probabilistic Prediction by Using Additional Knowledge
abstract: "Venn Machine is a recently developed machine learning framework for reliable
  probabilistic prediction of the labels for new examples.\r This work proposes a
  way to extend Venn machine to the framework known as Learning Under Privileged Information:\r
  some additional features are available for a part of the training set, and are missing
  for the example being predicted.\r We make use of this information by making a taxonomy
  transfer, where taxonomy is the core detail of Venn Machine framework.\r The transfer
  is done from the examples with additional information to the examples without additional
  information."
