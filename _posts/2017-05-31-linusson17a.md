title: On the Calibration of Aggregated Conformal Predictors
abstract: "Conformal prediction is a learning framework that produces models that
  associate with each of their predictions a measure of statistically valid confidence.\r
  These models are typically constructed on top of traditional machine learning algorithms.\r
  An important result of conformal prediction theory is that the models produced are
  provably valid under relatively weak assumptions—in particular,\r their validity
  is independent of the specific underlying learning algorithm on which they are based.\r
  Since validity is automatic, much research on conformal predictors has been focused
  on improving their informational and computational efficiency.\r As part of the
  efforts in constructing efficient conformal predictors, aggregated conformal predictors
  were developed,\r drawing inspiration from the field of classification and regression
  ensembles.\r Unlike early definitions of conformal prediction procedures, the validity
  of aggregated conformal predictors is not fully understood—while it has been shown\r
  that they might attain empirical exact validity under certain circumstances,\r their
  theoretical validity is conditional on additional assumptions that require further
  clarification.\r In this paper, we show why validity is not automatic for aggregated
  conformal predictors,\r and provide a revised definition of aggregated conformal
  predictors that gains approximate validity\r conditional on properties of the underlying
  learning algorithm."
