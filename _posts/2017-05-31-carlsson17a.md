title: Comparing Performance of Different Inductive and Transductive Conformal Predictors
  Relevant to Drug Discovery
abstract: "We present an evaluation of the impact of transductive, inductive, aggregated
  and cross inductive mondrian conformal prediction\r on the validity and efficiency
  of predictions.\r The aim of the study is to give guidance to which methods perform
  best where there is limited data.\r The evaluation has been made on a large public
  dataset of Ames mutagenicity data, relevant for drug discovery,\r a spam dataset
  and a diverse set of drug discovery datasets.\r When considering predictions only,
  the transductive conformal predictor performs the best in terms of validity.\r If
  however more information is required, for example interpretation of a prediction,\r
  then any of the methods that calculate an averaged p-value should be considered."
